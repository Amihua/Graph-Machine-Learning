## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
base_classifier = KerasClassifier(model=base_model,\
                                  clip_values=(min_, max_))
y_test_mdsample_prob = np.max(y_test_prob[sampl_md_idxs],\
                                                       axis=1)
y_test_smsample_prob = np.max(y_test_prob[sampl_sm_idxs],\
                                                       axis=1)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and data stewards who have an increasingly critical responsibility to explain how the AI systems they develop work, their impact on decision making, and how they identify and manage bias. Working knowledge of machine learning and the Python programming language is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).

## Get to Know the Authors
**Serg Masís**
has been at the confluence of the internet, application development, and analytics for the last two decades. Currently, he's a Climate and Agronomic Data Scientist at Syngenta, a leading agribusiness company with a mission to improve global food security. Before that role, he co-founded a startup, incubated by Harvard Innovation Labs, that combined the power of cloud computing and machine learning with principles in decision-making science to expose users to new places and events. Whether it pertains to leisure activities, plant diseases, or customer lifetime value, Serg is passionate about providing the often-missing link between data and decision-making — and machine learning interpretation helps bridge this gap more robustly.
